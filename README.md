# Library Application

Library application is originally a MDN tutorial to learn Node.js.
<strong>However, it is now something different from the original tutorial. Code is fully
refactored. Old javascript converted to ES6+. Controllers are divided into services,
validation schemas and database access layers.</strong>
Library application has all features to work on CRUD operations.
It is using Express as back-end and server-side rendering done via pug template 
engine. It uses MongoDB for the database.
